Bug 1: Threshold Validation Error

- Description: The script fails to validate the threshold value, allowing it to exceed the total number of shares.
- Severity: High
- Proof: split_secret(6, 5, b"Rahasia123", 8) raises no error.
- Recommendation: Implement threshold validation.

Bug 2: Insufficient Index Bits

- Description: The script fails to check if the index bits are sufficient to accommodate the total number of shares.
- Severity: Medium
- Proof: split_secret(3, 10, b"Rahasia123", 4) raises no error.
- Recommendation: Implement index bits validation.

Bug 3: Entropy Generation Weakness

- Description: The generate_entropy function may produce weak entropy, compromising share security.
- Severity: High
- Proof: Analysis of generate_entropy function reveals potential weakness.
- Recommendation: Upgrade to a cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator.

Bug 4: Interpolation Error

- Description: The script fails to handle invalid x values during interpolation.
- Severity: Medium
- Proof: restore_secret(shares, x=256) raises no error.
- Recommendation: Implement x value validation.

Bug 5: Brute Force Vulnerability

- Description: The script is vulnerable to brute-force attacks due to insufficient share encryption.
- Severity: High
- Proof: Analysis reveals potential for brute-force attacks.
- Recommendation: Implement robust encryption mechanisms.

Recommendations

1. Implement threshold validation.
2. Upgrade to cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generators.
3. Implement index bits validation.
4. Enhance share encryption mechanisms.
5. Conduct regular security audits.
